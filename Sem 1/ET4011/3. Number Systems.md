## Positional Weighted Number Systems:
The position of the symbols matters. It would be impossible without '0' or an equivalent value
Position of the digit shows weighting by powers of 10: $...10^3 10^2 10^1 10^0 . 10^{-1} 10^{-2} ...$
Examples: $10.99 = 1×10^1 + 0×10^0 + 9×10^{-1} + 9×10^{-2}$

Similarly, for binary numbers: $1101.11 = 1×2^3 + 1×2^2 + 0×2^1 + 1×2^0 + 1×2^{-1} + 1×2^{-2}$

__MSB__ = Most Significant Bit; the leftmost bit
__LSB__   = Least Significant Bit; the rightmost bit

## Fractional Binary Numbers
```math
2^{-1} = {1}/{2^1}\ \ \ \ \ 2^{-2} = {1}/{2^2}\ \ \ \ \ 2^{-3} = {1}/{2^3}
```
Converting a number with fractional binary to decimal
Example: 
```math
1.1011 = 1×2^0 + 1×2^{-1} + 0×2^{-2} + 1×2^{-3} + 1×2^{-4}
= 1×1 + 1×{1/2} + 0 + 1×{1/8} + 1×{1/16}
= 1 + 0.5 + 0 + 0.125 + 0.0625
= 1.6875
```

## Repeating Binary Fractions

## Resolution
Is the smallest step between two consecutive numbers.
$0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101$

## Maximum Size of Binary Numbers
For 8 bits: $11111111 = 255$

## Binary Arithmetic
Addition: $0 + 0 = 0\ \ \ \ 0 + 1 = 1\ \ \ \ 1 + 0 = 1\ \ \ \ 1 + 1 = 10$
Subtraction: $0 - 0 = 0\ \ \ \ 1 - 0 = 1\ \ \ \ 0 - 1 = ?\ \ \ \ 1 - 1 = 0$
Multiplication by two: is done by _shifting_ to the __LEFT__.
Division by two: is done by _shifting_ to the __RIGHT__.

## Signed Numbers

__Sign Magnitude System__
One of the bits is used to represent the sign of the number. 
E.g.:
- `4` in binary is `0100`
- `-4` in binary is `1100`
The leftmost bit represents the sign of the number.

__2's Complement__
2's complement is a special type of number system that is capable of representing both positive and negative numbers.

| Decimal | 2's Complement |
| ------- | -------------- |
| 3       | 0011           |
| 2       | 0010           |
| 1       | 0001           |
| 0       | 0000           |
| -1      | 1111           |
| -2      | 1110           |
| -3      | 1101           |
| -4      | 1100               |

The range of numbers available in 2's complement signed binary with N bits is
$-2^{N-1}$ to $2^{N-1}-1$

How to form 2's complement:
- For positive numbers, the 2's complement form is the same as the unsigned binary version of the number extended to the required number of bits, but with a `0` in the leftmost position.
	Example:
	In 8-bit 2's complement, `54 (dec) = 0011 0110 (bin)`
	In 16-bit 2's complement, `54 (dec) = 0000 0000 0011 0110 (bin)`
- For negative numbers, they are formed as follows:
	1. Convert the magnitude (size) of the number to unsigned binary.
	2. Find the 1's complement of the unsigned binary number by interchanging the `1`'s and `0`'s.
	3. Add `1` to the result.
	4. This is the 2's complement.
	5. If we require more bits, extend to the left with `1`
	Example:
	Find -54 in 8-bit 2's complement:
	- The magnitude of 54 in binary is given by 110110
	- Before we convert to 1's complement first extend the magnitude to 8 bits with `0`: 00110110
	- Convert to 1's complement by inverting the bits: 11001001
	- Add `1`: 11001001 + 1 = __11001010__

## Hexadecimal to Binary

One Hexadecimal corresponds to 4 bits:

| Hex | Bin  |
| --- | ---- |
| 1   | 0001 |
| 2   | 0010 |
| 3   |    0011  |
| 4   |   0100   |
| 5   |   0101   |
| 6   |   0110   |
| 7   |   0111   |
| 8   |   1000   |
| 9   |    1001  |
| A   |    1010  |
| B   |   1011   |
| C   |   1100   |
| D   |  1101    |
| E   |    1110  |
| F    |   1111   |

## Fixed v. Floating Point Numbers
Fixed point numbers are limited by the number of bits:
- 16 bits: 0 to 65,535 or -32,768 to +32,767
- 32 bits:

The __floating point number notation__ is a more compact notation for expressing very large and very small numbers. It allows a wider range of representation of numbers and a greater precision.

Floating point is the same in binary, shown here in a human readable 'in-between' format:$$+1.01 \times 2^y$$ They are stored in 32 bits as follows:
- 1 bit for the sign
- 8 bits for the exponent field
- 23 bits for the mantissa field

>Example:
>13.5 in binary is 1101.1
>The number is positive so the sign bit is 0
>We represent it as $1.1011 \times 2^y$
>We determine the value of $y$ so that the number is equal to 1101.1
>The final result is $1.1011 \times 2^3$
