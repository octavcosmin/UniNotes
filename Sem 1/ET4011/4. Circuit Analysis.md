How to Proceed:
1. Start at the Left, move to the Right
2. Work out the output of each gate, based on type
   
## Boolean Equation from the Circuit Analysis

The Boolean Equation from the analysis of this circuit is:
$$
X = AB + A(B + C) + B(B + C)
$$
Using the Distributive Law:
$$
X = AB + AB + AC + BB + BC
$$
Simplified:
$$
X = AB + AC + B + BC
$$
Truth table for the equation:

| A   | B   | C   | X   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |  0   |
| 0   | 0   | 1   |  0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |  1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |  1   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |  0   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |  1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |  1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |  1   |
   
## Circuit from Truth Table

| A   | B   | C   | X   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1    |

If A = 0 AND B = 1 AND C = 0, then X = 1 $\Leftrightarrow \overline A B \overline C$
If A = 1 AND B = 0 AND C = 1, then X = 1 $\Leftrightarrow A \overline B C$
If A = 1 AND B = 1 AND C = 0, then X = 1 $\Leftrightarrow AB \overline C$
If A = 1 AND B = 1 AND C = 1, then X = 1 $\Leftrightarrow$ ABC

So, the Boolean Equation is: $\overline A B \overline C + A \overline B C + A B \overline C + ABC$
