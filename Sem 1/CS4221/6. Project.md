Write a $\lambda$ calculus expression that takes three arguments and applies the first argument to the second and multiplies the results with the third argument.$$(\lambda xyz. (*\ (x\ y)\ z))$$

Write a $\lambda$ calculus expression that takes three arguments and applies the first argument to the second and third argument and returns the square of the result. $$(\lambda xyx. (sqr\ (x\ y\ z)))$$
Write a $\lambda$ calculus expression that applies a Boolean operator and returns `#f`$$(\lambda x.\ (and\ x\ \#f))$$
Write a $\lambda$ calculus expression that checks equality between two numbers and prints "true" if they are equal $$(\lambda xy.\ (if\ (=\ x\ y)\ (displayln\ "true")\ (displayln\ "false")))$$
