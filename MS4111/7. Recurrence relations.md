## Sequences

$a_0,a_1,a_2,...$
We denote the sequence by $\{a_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$, $\{a_n\}_n$ or $\{a_n\}$

## Recurrence relations and initial conditions

_Recurrence relation_ for $a_n$ - relates $a_n$ to some of its predecessors
_Initial conditions_

A _closed form_ recurrence relation is a formula that solves $a_n$ in terms of $n$.

>__Example:__ the Fibonacci sequence: $$f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}\space ,\quad n \geq 3$$

A relation is __homogeneous__ if EVERY term requires one or more terms in the sequence: $$\mathnormal {Example:}\space a_n = a_{n-3}^3sin^2(a_{n-4}) + 7a_{n-2}^3$$
Otherwise, the relation is __inhomogeneous__: $$\mathnormal{Example:}\space a_n = a_{n-3}^3sin^2(a_{n-4}) + 7a_{n-2}^3 + \underline{7n + 4}$$
A recurrence relation is __linear homogeneous of order k with constant coefficients__ if it is of the form$$a_n = c_1a_{n-1}+c_2a_{n-2}+...+c_ka_{n-k}$$ 
>__Example:__ The recurrence relation $$a_n=3a_{n-1}-5a_{n-4}$$is linear homogeneous of order 4 with constant coefficients
