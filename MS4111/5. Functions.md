A function $f$ from a set $X$ to a set $Y$ is a [[4. Relations of Sets|relation]] from $X$ to $Y$ satisfying the following conditions:
1. Domain of $f = X$
2. If $(x, y1) \in f$ and $(x, y2) \in f$ then $y1 = y2$

>__Example:__
>Consider $X = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$, $Y=\{0,1,2\}$, $f=\{(x, x MOD 3)|x \in X$\}
>We can list the elements of $f$: $$f = \{(1,1),(2,2),(3,0),(4,1),(5,2)\}$$
>$f$ is a function since no two distinct ordered pairs have the same first element.

If $f \subset X \times Y$ is a function from $X$ to $Y$ and we write $f:X \rightarrow Y,$ then for each $x \in X$ there is exactly one $y \in Y$ such that $(x,y) \in f.$ We denote this by $y=f(x).$

If $f:X \rightarrow Y$ is a function then $Y$ is the codomain of $f$.

For any function $f$ from $X$ to $Y$ we will denote the range of $f$ by $R(f)$ or $Im(f$).

If $f:X \rightarrow Y$ is a function, then $Im(f) \subseteq Y$.

## Properties of Functions

A function is __injective (or one-to-one)__ if for each $y$ there is _at most_ one $x$ such that $f(x) = y$.
	Also if for any $x, x' \in X$ we have $f(x)=f(x') \Leftrightarrow x=x'$.

A function is __surjective (or onto Y)__ if $Im(f)=Y$.
	In other words if $\forall y \in Y,\quad$ $\exists x \in X\quad$ such that $\quad y=f(x)$.

A function is __bijective (or a bijection)__ if it is _injective_ and _surjective_.
