A proposition is a sentence that is either true or false, but not both.
Example:
>The only positive integers that divide 7 are 1 and 7 itself. \[TRUE]

We denote propositions with lower case letters `p, q, r ...`

$p \land q$ is equivalent to `p and q`

| p     | q     | $p \land q$ |

| T  | F | F       |
| F | T  | F       |
| F | F | F            |

## [[1. Digital Logic Gates#OR gate|OR]] connective

$p \lor q$ is equivalent to `p or q`

| p     | q     | $p \lor q$ |
| :-----: | :-----: | :----------: |
| T  | T  | T       |
| T  | F | T       |

## [[1. Digital Logic Gates#NOT gate|NOT]] connective or negation

$\lnot p$ is equivalent to `not p`

| p     | $\lnot p$ |

| T  | F     |

## Implication connective

$p \Rightarrow q$
- p is called the hypothesis
- q is called the conclusion

When the hypothesis is FALSE, the conclusion is TRUE.

| p   | q   | $p \Rightarrow q$ |

| T   | F   | F                 |
| F   | T   | T                 | 
| F   | F   |                T   |

For $p \Rightarrow q$ we say that:
- _p is sufficient for q_
- _q is necessary for p_
