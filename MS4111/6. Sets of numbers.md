The set of natural numbers $\mathbb N = \{0,1,2,...\}$ is an example of an inductive set defined by
1. A basic element: $0 \in \mathbb N$
2. an inductive step: if $n \in \mathbb N$, then $n + 1 \in \mathbb N$

>Principle of mathematical induction:
>Suppose that 
>1. $P(1)$ is TRUE (_basic step_)
>2. If $P(i)$ is TRUE for all $i = 1,...n$, then $P(n+1)$ is TRUE (_inductive step_)
>Then the principle of Mathematical Induction says that if 1. and 2. are satisfied then:
>$P(n)$ is TRUE for every natural number $n$.

## Integers $\mathbb Z$

For $\mathbb N$ we can have:
$2 = 2 - 0$
$2 = 3 - 1$
$2 = 4 - 2$
etc.
$\Downarrow$
$(2,0)\mathcal R (3,1)$, or the general $(n,m)\mathcal R (n',m')$, where the relation $\mathcal R$ is $n + m' = m + n'$, for example $2 + 1 = 3 + 0$.
We can define the same for $\mathbb Z$.

## From $\mathbb Z$ to $\mathbb Q$

Once the set of integers is defined, then it can be extended to the set of rational numbers: $\mathbb Z \in \mathbb Q$, where $\mathbb Q$ is the _set of rational numbers_.

$(2,3) \mathcal R (4,6)$, where the relation $\mathcal R$ is $n \times m' = n' \times m$.

## Axiomatic definition of the field of real numbers

There is an operation "$+$" on $\mathbb R$: $$+: \mathbb R \times \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R$$
which satisfies the following properties:
1. Commutative law
2. Associative law
3. There exists an _additive identity_ denoted by $0$ such that: $\forall a, \space a + 0 = a$
4. $\forall a$, there exists an element, called the _additive inverse of a_ and denoted by $-a$ such that: $a + (-a) = 0$
