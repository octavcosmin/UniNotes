A von Neumann computer has three hardware sub-systems:
- CPU
- Memory
- I/O
It has the capacity to carry out sequential operations.

## CPU

The CPU:
- executes your program,
- operates on data in memory,
- sends and receives output and input data

The CPU has 3 elements:
- Control Unit (CU) - sequences the operations
- Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) - does the operations using combinational logic
- Internal Registers (IR)

## Memory Organization

Memory is where the program and the data are stored.
Locations in memory have addresses, which is a way to uniquely specify an individual location in memory, usually a byte.

A computer specifies an address as a binary number. To select a location in memory, the CPU sends out the unique binary pattern on a _set of wires_ connected to the memory.

## Reading and Writing Data

The technical term for a set of wires connecting devices or logical blocks is a __bus__. A bus can be used inside a chip or can be the connection between chips.

## Harvard vs von Neumann computer

While a von Neumann computer stores data memory (RAM) and program memory (ROM) in the same place, a Harvard computer separates RAM and ROM memory. This makes Harvard architecture computers more expensive and difficult to design, but also more efficient.
