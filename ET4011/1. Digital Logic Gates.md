## AND gate
![[Pasted image 20230921090432.png]]

Output is true __if and only if__ both inputs are true.

Boolean equation: X = A.B

Truth table:

| A   | B   | X   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |

## OR gate
![[Pasted image 20230921090416.png]]

Output is true if __at least one__ of the inputs is true.

Boolean Equation: X = A+B

Truth table:

| A   | B   | X   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0    |
| 0   | 1   |   1  |
| 1   | 0   |  1   |
| 1   | 1    |  1   |

## NOT gate 
![[Pasted image 20230921090348.png]]

Output is the __opposite__ of the input.

Boolean equation: X = A' OR X = Ā

Truth table:

| A   | X   |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 0    |

---
## XOR gate
![[Pasted image 20230921090946.png]]
Output is true if __one__ of the inputs is true. It's false if both are true.

Boolean equation: X = A ⊕ B

Truth table:

| A   | B   | X   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |

## NAND gate
![[Pasted image 20230921091755.png]]
Output is true if __not__ both of the inputs are true.

X = (A.B)'


Truth table:

| A   | B   | X   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0    |

---
## NOR gate
![[Pasted image 20230921092510.png]]
Output is true if __both__ inputs are false.

Boolean equation: X = (A+B)'

Truth table:

| A   | B   | X   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 0    |
