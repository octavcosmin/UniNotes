## Push
ARM does not have a __PUSH__ instruction. Instead we use:
```assembly
SUB SP, SP, #8
STR Xn, [SP]
```

## Pop
Similarly to __PUSH__ we have to use multiple instructions to replace __POP__:
```assembly
LDR Xn, [SP]
ADD SP, SP, #8
```

## Standardized register use
- `X0` to `X7`: passed in parameters
- `X0` (also `X1` and `X2` if needed): returned data
- `X9` to `X17`: temporary registers
- `X19` to `X28`: saved registers

## Procedures
For a nested call, the caller needs to save on the stack:
- its return address
- arguments and temporary registers needed after the call
Then it has to restore everything from the stack.
