## Boolean Quantities
In Boolean Algebra we only deal with two values: 0 and 1.
When we don't know the value we use variables. Usually A, B, C, D for inputs and X, Y, Z for outputs
## Terminology
Variable:
> Rebresented by a letter, e.g. A, B, C, D, X, Y, Z
> A variable represents a logical quantity.
> It can have the values 0 or 1.

Complement:
>The opposite or inverse of a variable.
>Written as A' or Ä€.
>Variable passed through a [[1. Digital Logic Gates#NOT gate]].

Literal:
>General term for variables and complements in Boolean equations.

## Boolean Operations
Boolean Addition:
Same as [[1. Digital Logic Gates#OR gate]]
>0 + 0 = 0
>0 + 1 = 1
>1 + 0 = 1
>1 + 1 = 1

Boolean Multiplication:
Same as [[1. Digital Logic Gates#AND gate]]
>0 . 0 = 0
>0 . 1 = 0
>1 . 0 = 0
>1 . 1 = 1
