## Boolean Quantities
In Boolean Algebra we only deal with two values: 0 and 1.
When we don't know the value we use variables. Usually A, B, C, D for inputs and X, Y, Z for outputs
## Terminology
Variable:
> Rebresented by a letter, e.g. A, B, C, D, X, Y, Z
> A variable represents a logical quantity.
> It can have the values 0 or 1.

Complement:
>The opposite or inverse of a variable.
>Written as A' or Ā.
>Variable passed through a [[1. Digital Logic Gates#NOT gate]].

Literal:
>General term for variables and complements in Boolean equations.

## Boolean Operations
Boolean Addition:
Same as [[1. Digital Logic Gates#OR gate]]
>0 + 0 = 0
>0 + 1 = 1
>1 + 0 = 1
>1 + 1 = 1

Boolean Multiplication:
Same as [[1. Digital Logic Gates#AND gate]]
>0 . 0 = 0
>0 . 1 = 0
>1 . 0 = 0
>1 . 1 = 1

## Laws of Boolean Algebra
Commutative law:
>A + B = B + A
>A . B = B . A

Associative law:
>(A . B) . C = A . (B . C)
>A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C

Distributive law:
>A . (B + C) = A . B + A . C

## Rules of Boolean Algebra
1. A + 0 = A
2. A + 1 = 1
3. A . 0 = 0
4. A . 1 = A
5. A + A = A
6. A + Ā = 1
7. A . A = A
8. A . Ā = 0
9. =A = A (Double inversion)
10. __A + AB = A__ = A . (1 + B) \[rule 2] = A . 1 \[rule 4] = A
11. __A + ĀB = A + B__ = A + AB + ĀB \[rule 10] = A + (A + Ā) . B \[rule 6] = A + 1 . B \[rule 4] = A+B
12. __(A + B) . (A + C) = A + BC__ = (A + B) . A + (A + B) . C = AA + AB + AC + BC = A + AB + AC + BC \[rule 10 twice] = A + BC
