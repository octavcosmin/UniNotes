[[1. Digital Logic Gates#AND gate|AND]], [[1. Digital Logic Gates#OR gate|OR]], [[1. Digital Logic Gates#NOT gate|NOT]] gates are examples of __Combinational Logic__.
A combinational logic circuit has no memory, and reflects only the inputs at a given time.

Sequential logic differs in two ways from combinational logic:
- it has a memory
- is controlled by an additional signal called CLOCK signal

A clock signal represents regular signals that act like a clock to regulate the behavior of the circuit. The __Period (T)__ of the signal is the duration of the unique waveform. The __Frequency__ is $f={1/T}$.
