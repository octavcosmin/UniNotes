[[1. Digital Logic Gates#AND gate|AND]], [[1. Digital Logic Gates#OR gate|OR]], [[1. Digital Logic Gates#NOT gate|NOT]] gates are examples of __Combinational Logic__.
A combinational logic circuit has no memory, and reflects only the inputs at a given time.

Sequential logic differs in two ways from combinational logic:
- it has a memory
- is controlled by an additional signal called CLOCK signal

A clock signal represents regular signals that act like a clock to regulate the behavior of the circuit. The __Period (T)__ of the signal is the duration of the unique waveform. The __Frequency__ is $f={1/T}$.

## Clock Signals and Edges
The edge of a clock is the bit where it changes from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0
- rising edge
- falling edge

## Flip-Flops
Flip-flops are triggered by clock edges. That means they 'store' or transfer the data into the device on a clock edge.

A J-K Flip-flop has two inputs, J and K plus the clock. J sets the flip-flop output to 1 and K clears the flip-flop output to 0, but they do this synchronized to the clock.

We describe flip-flops in __function tables__.

| $\overline{CLEAR}$ | CLK | J   | K   | $Q$   | $\overline Q$ |
| :------------------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :-------------: |
| 0                  | X   | X   | X   | 0   | 1             |
| 1                  |  ↓   |   0  |  0   |  $Q$   |    $\overline Q$           |
| 1                  |  ↓   | 1    |  0   | 1    |  0             |
| 1                  |  ↓   |  0   |  1   |  0   |    1           |
| 1                  |   ↓  |  1   |  1   |  $\overline Q$   |    $Q$           |
| 1                  |  1   |  X   |  X   |  $Q$   |     $\overline Q$          |

## 2-bit Asynchronous Counter
We set J and K to 1 and use Q as the clock to the second J-K Flip-Flop.
