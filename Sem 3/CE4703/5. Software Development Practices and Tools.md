# Doxygen
---
Doxygen is a documentation generator and static analysis tool. It extracts information from specially-formatted comments within the code.
Special comment blocks are required to parse them into Doxygen

**Javadoc** style:
```c
/**
 * put your comments here..
 */
```

**Qt** style:
```c
/*!
 * put your comments here..
 */
```

**C++** style:
```c
///
/// put comments here..
///
```

Special Comment Blocks are added before the item that it describes:
```c
int var1; /**< Descriotion after member*/
int var2; /*!< Description after member*/
int var3; ///< Description after member
```

### Doxygen Common Commands
All commands start with either backslash (\\) or at-sign (@).
```c
/**
 * @file
 * @brief
 * @details
 * @param <name>
 * @return
 * @author
 * @authors
 * @date
 */
```
