Strings such as "hello" are stored as an array of individual characters in **C**. A character array can be initialized using a string literal.
```c
char string1[] = "first";
```
String literal `"first"` contains five characters plus a special string-termination character called the *null character*. All strings in **C** end with this character.

Character arrays can also be initialized with individual character constants in an initializer list like this:
```c
char string1[] = {'f', 'i', 'r', 's', 't', '\0'};
```

We can also input a string directly into a character array from the keyboard using `scanf`/`scanf_s` and the conversion specifier `%s`.
```c
scanf_s("%s", &string1);
```

The statements
```c
scanf("%19s", string2);
// and
scanf_s("%19s", string2, 20); 
// NOTE: buffer size includes the null character
```
read a string of at most 19 characters (+ `'\0'`) into `string2`.
**NOTE:** 
- `scanf_s()` requires size of buffer for all character-based types (`%c` and `%s`).
- If the read variable is already a pointer, **the `&` sign is not required** for reading.

The array `string2` is printed with the statement
```c
printf("%s", string2);
```

Initialization in row-order format:
```c
int a[2][3] = {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}};
