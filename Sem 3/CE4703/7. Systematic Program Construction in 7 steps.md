1. Task Formulation
2. Specification
>Input: Radius real number, 0 < r â‰¤ 1000 with double precision
>Output: V = volume of sphere with radius r, rounded to 2 decimal points
3. Problem solving
$$V = {4 \over 3} \times \pi \times r^3$$
4. Top-Down Construction
5. Desktop Testing
>If paper testing doesn't work, go back to step 4.
6. Coding
>Convert math/natural language into code.
7. Testing
>Test if the program works.
