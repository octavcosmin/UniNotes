## Single Linked List
---
The purpose is to store any number of elements in sequential order. In an array, the order is defined by memory location, while in linked lists, the order is explicitly given by links between elements (nodes).
Nodes can be added into a linked list at any position and at any given time, and removed from any position.

An empty Single Linked List:
**H**ead-> **T**ail

Single Linked List with elements:
**H** -> 'A' -> 'L' -> 'I' -> 'S' -> 'T' -> **T**

### Operations on Linked Lists
Insertion at/removal from any position in list and moving elements are very efficient operations. These involve creation/removal of a node and change of some links.
However, accessing random elements is inefficient, as it requires to step through the whole linked list from head to tail until the element is found.

**Adding New Nodes**
1. Create new node
2. Set link from new node to its successor
3. Set link from predecessor to new node

**Removing Nodes**
1. Set link from predecessor to successor of node
2. Remove node

**Moving Nodes**
1. Copy link to node to be moved
2. Set link from predecessor to successor of node
3. Set link from node to new successor
4. Set link from new predecessor to node

### Required Operations for Linked List
- Create a new empty linked list
- Delete an existing linked list
	- Make sure to remove all nodes
	- Decide whether or not data in nodes should also need to be deleted
- Ability to access elements stored in node of the linked list
	- Usually some form of "current node" is maintained.
- Move through the list
	- Single Linked list works in one direction only
	- Provide "go back to start/head" and "move to next node"
- Add a new element to linked list
	- Decide where to insert the element (after current node or passed pointer)
- Remove an element from linked list
	- Decide which one to delete (usually the successor of current node)

```c
llist *listCreate();
void listDelete(llist *list);
data *accessData(llist *list);
void gotoHead(llist *list);
llError gotoNextNode(llist *list);
llError insertAfter(data *d, llist *list);
llError deleteNext(llist *list);
