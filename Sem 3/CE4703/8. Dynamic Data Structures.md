## Single Linked List
---
The purpose is to store any number of elements in sequential order. In an array, the order is defined by memory location, while in linked lists, the order is explicitly given by links between elements (nodes).
Nodes can be added into a linked list at any position and at any given time, and removed from any position.

An empty Single Linked List:
**H**ead-> **T**ail

Single Linked List with elements:
**H** -> 'A' -> 'L' -> 'I' -> 'S' -> 'T' -> **T**

### Operations on Linked Lists
Insertion at/removal from any position in list and moving elements are very efficient operations. These involve creation/removal of a node and change of some links.
However, accessing random elements is inefficient, as it requires to step through the whole linked list from head to tail until the element is found.

**Adding New Nodes**
1. Create new node
2. Set link from new node to its successor
3. Set link from predecessor to new node
