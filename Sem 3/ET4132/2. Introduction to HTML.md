## HTML Elements
---
Almost all HTML tags come in pairs, except a few, such as:
- `<img>`
- `<meta>`
- `<link>`
- `<br>`
They should be closed with a ` />`. For example `<meta charset="utf-8 />` or `<br />`

## Basic HTML document structure
---
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title> Document Title Goes Here </title>
	</head>
	<body>
		Document content goes here
	</body>
</html>
```

`<!DOCTYPE>` must be at the start of every file, but it is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

## HTML Tag Attributes
---
For example, the `<body>` can have the `style` argument, which can be used to tell the browser what the background color of the page should be.
```html
<body style="background-color: red;">
```

## Basic HTML Tags
---
The most important HTML tags are the ones that define headings, paragraphs and line breaks:
- `<html>`
- `<body>`
- `<p>`
- `<h1>` through `<h6>`
- `<br>`
- comments `<!-- This is a comment -->`

## HTML Character Entities
---
Some characters have a special meaning in HTML, e.g. the `<` sign. To actually insert and display these characters we need to add the entity name or number. For example, to insert a space (non-breaking space), we need to write `&nbsp` or `&#160`.

## HTML Lists
---
### Ordered Lists
An ordered list item starts with `<ol>`, and each item has a `<li>` tag.

### Unordered Lists
An unordered list is also a list of items, with the list items marked with bullets.
The unordered list item starts with `<ul>`, and each item has a `<li>` tag.
