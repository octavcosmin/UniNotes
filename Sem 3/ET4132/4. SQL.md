A database language should allow the user to:
- Create the database
- Create, modify and delete data
- Perform queries
- Has a simple syntax
- Is portable

The ISO SQL standard has two major parts:
- Data Definition Language (DDL) - defines database structure
- Data Manipulation Language (DML) - for retrieving and updating data


| **CRUD**   | Operations | SQL Statement/Command |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| **C**reate |            |                       |
| **R**ead   |            |                       |
| **U**pdate |            |                       |
| **D**elete |            |                       |

## Pattern Matching
---
```sql
Name LIKE 'Peter' — matches "Peter"
Name = 'Peter'    — matches "Peter"
Name LIKE 'P%'    — matches anything starting with "P"
Name = 'P%'       — matches "P%"
```

## Ordering
---
```sql
SELECT sno, fname, lname, salary
	FROM staff
	ORDERED BY salary DESC;
```

## Aggregate Functions
---
ISO standard defines 5 aggregate functions:
- `COUNT`
- `SUM`
- `AVG`
- `MIN`
- `MAX`

The `HAVING` keyword is designed for use with `GTOUP BY`.

## Subqueries
---
Example: List staff who work in the branch at '163 Main St'.
```sql
SELECT sno, fname, lname, position
FROM staff
WHERE bno =
	(SELECT bno
	FROM branch
	WHERE street = '163 Main St');
```

## Multi-Table Queries
---
To perform a **join**, include more than one table in the `FROM` clause.

FULL OUTER JOIN
```sql
SELECT r.rno, fname, lname, pno, comment
FROM renter r, viewing v
WHERE r.rno = v.rno;
```
