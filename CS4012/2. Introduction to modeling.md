A model is a _simplified illustration of a real situation_.
Concepts:
- Abstraction
- Mapping

Real-world problem →                Math problem                   →             Make assumptions

Real-world solution ← Interpret solutions/results with data ← Identify/construct math models

Abstraction:
- Highlight relevant details
- Leave out irrelevant details

Advantages of modeling:
- Achieve greater understanding of a problem
- Facilitates decision making
- Cost-effective
- Convenient
- Models can be reasoned about

Essential features of a model:
- Easy to use and maintain
- Comprehensively documented
- Cost-effective

Models can be:
- __Descriptive__: description of something that exists.
- __Prescriptive__: Provide the best solution to a problem

Types of models:
- __Iconic__ models bear some resemblance to the original object
- __Analogic__ models involve representing the properties of the problem by distinct features of the model
- __Symbolic__ models need to be learned

__Problem 1__
>The task is to join A-F, B-D and C-E by wires such that the wires do not intersect

>It is __NOT__ possible to connect all utilities to all houses without having to dig at least one deeper excavation.
