__Problem 1__
>One morning at 8am I set off for a friend’s house a long distance away. There are traffic delays and I stop off a couple of times for a break. I arrive at 6pm and stay overnight. The next morning, I leave at 8am and head for home. I encounter more traffic delays and take just one break. I arrive home at 6pm. Is there some point on the road that I pass at exactly the same time on the outward and return journeys? (Vickers, 2008)



__Problem 2__
>Take a chessboard (64 squares) and 32 dominoes. Each domino fits over two (non-diagonally) adjacent squares on the chessboard. Now cut off two opposite corners of the chessboard (Suppose top left and bottom right as per net slide) and remove one domino. Now you have 62 squares and 31 dominoes. Can you still cover the chessboard? 

By taking away 2 squares of the same color there are 2 less squares of one colour. A domino covers a black square and a white square, so covering the entire board is not possible anymore.

__Problem 3__
>The hard drive in Nick’s computer has twice the capacity of Alf’s. Between them their computers have 240 gigabytes of hard-drive storage. What is the capacity of each hard-drive? (Vickers, 2008)
