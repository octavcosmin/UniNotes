## IP and IP Addresses
---
Every address on a TCP/IP network must have a unique IP address.
IP addresses (at the Network Layer) are independent of the Data Link layer.
There are restrictions for the addresses assigned.

__The IP address consists of two parts:__
- The Network ID or network address
- The host ID or host address
All 0 values for the host ID refers to the network itself and are not usable for hosts.

__Representing IP Addresses:__
Usually represented in a dotted decimal notation. Each group of 8 bits is represented by its decimal value.

__IP Classes:__
IP defines five address classes, A to E
- Class A: __(0)__ first bit is zero
- Class B: __(10)__ first bit is one, second one is zero
- Class C: __(110)__ first two bits are 1, third bit is zero
- Class D is for multicast addresses. __(1110)__
- Class E (experimental) is not used. __(11110)__

__Subnetting:__
Subnetting lets you use 32 IP address bits efficiently. It allows an arbitrary number of bits to be used for the network ID.
A subnet is a network that falls within a Class A, B or C network.

__Subnet Masks:__
If the IP address in bit notation is:
`10010000 00011100 00010000 00000000` - `144.28.16.0`
`10010000 00011100 00100000 00000000` - `144.28.32.0`
Then the address mask is:
`11111111 11111111 11110000 00000000` - `255.255.240.0`

__CIDR Notation:__
The number of consecutive bits with the value of `1` at the beginning.
For example, for the address mask `11111111 11111111 11110000 00000000` - `255.255.240.0`, CIDR is `/20`.

## Private Address Spaces
---

| CIDR | Address Range |
| ---- | ---- |
| 10.0.0.0/8 | 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 |
| 172.16.0.0/12 | 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 |
| 192.0.0.0/24 | 192.0.0.0 - 192.0.0.255 |
## NAT

## IPv6
---
- 128 bits long
- organized in groups of four hexadecimal digits
- looks similar to MAC address, but the MAC address has fewer digits organized in groups of two
