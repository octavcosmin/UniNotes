$$\mathrm{CPU\ Execution\ Time\ for\ a\ Program} = $$
## Classic CPU Performance Equation
---
Instruction Count is the number of instructions executed by the program
$$\mathrm{CPU\ time} = {\mathrm{Instruction\ Count} \times \mathrm{CPI} \over \mathrm{Clock\ Rate}}$$
__Components of performance:__
- CPU execution time for a program
- Instruction count
- __CPI__ - Clock cycles per Instruction
- Clock cycle time
