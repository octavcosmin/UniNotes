## ARMv8 R-format Instructions
---

| opcode | Rm  | shamt | Rn  | Rd  |
| ------ | --- | ----- | --- | --- |
Instruction fields:
- _Rm_ - the second register source operand
- _shamt_ - shift ammount
- _Rn_ - the first register source operand
- _Rd_ - the register destination
## ARMv8 D-format Instructions
---

| opcode | address | op2 | Rn  | Rt  |
| ------ | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
Used for __Load/Store__ instructions. 
Instruction fields:
- _Rn_ - base register
- _address_ - constant offset from contents of base register
- _Rt_ - destination (for load) or source (for store) register
## ARMv8 I-format Instructions
---


| opcode | immediate | Rn  | Rd  |
| ------ | --------- | --- | --- |
Instruction fields:
- _Rn_ - source register
- _Rd_ - destination register

## ARMv8 Branch Addressing
---
### B-type 

| 5 (6 bits) | go-to location (26 bits) |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
### CB-type

| 181 (8 bits) | go-to location (19 bits) | Rc  |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | --- |
- _Rc_ - register to compare as condition

## Direct Mapped Cache
---
Except for small cache organization, fully associative cache is not practical.
Tag comparison and data access can be performed at the same time. Tag RAM is small, tag access is completed before data access.
__However__, 2 items with the same cache address will contend for the use of a cache entry, so the technique needs to be modified:
- Option 1: Fully associative Cache - can remap cache lines anywhere
- Option 2 (the good one): duplicate the cache. This is named __2-way set-associative cache__
