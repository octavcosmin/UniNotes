Host sending packets of data:
- takes application message
- breaks it in chunks known as packets, of length $L$ bits
- transmits packets at a data rate $R$
$$\mathrm{packet\ transmission\ delay} = {L \over R}$$
The network __edge__: clients and servers
The network __core__: mesh of interconnected routers
> Two key netrork-core functions:
> Forwarding: router sends data to specific output (Local action)
> Routing: determining source-destination paths (Global action)

### Packet Switching vs Circuit Switching
---
example:
- 1 Gb/s link
- each user: 100Mb/s when active; active 10% of the time

Circuit switching: ${1Gb \over 100Mb} = 10\ users$
Packet switching: with 35 users, the probability of > 10 users active at the same time is less than $.0004\%$
