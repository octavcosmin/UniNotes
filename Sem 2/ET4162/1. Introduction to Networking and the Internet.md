Host sending packets of data:
- takes application message
- breaks it in chunks known as packets, of length $L$ bits
- transmits packets at a data rate $R$
$$\mathrm{packet\ transmission\ delay} = {L \over R}$$
The network __edge__: clients and servers
The network __core__: mesh of interconnected routers
> Two key network-core functions:
> Forwarding: router sends data to specific output (Local action)
> Routing: determining source-destination paths (Global action)

### Packet Switching vs Circuit Switching
---
example:
- 1 Gb/s link
- each user: 100Mb/s when active; active 10% of the time

Circuit switching: ${1Gb \over 100Mb} = 10\ users$
Packet switching: with 35 users, the probability of > 10 users active at the same time is less than $.0004\%$

## Packet delay and loss
---
Packets __queue__ in router buffers, waiting for turn for transmission.
Packet __loss__ occurs when the router's memory is full of packets queueing.

__Sources of Packet delay:__
$d_{nodal} = d_{proc} + d_{queue} + d_{trans} + d_{prop}$

| $d_{proc}$ : nodal processing<br>- check bit errors<br>- determine output link<br>- usually less than microseconds | $d_{queue}$ : queueing delay<br>- time waiting at output link for transmission<br>- depends on congestion level of router<br> |
| ---- | ---- |
| $d_{trans}$ : transmission delay<br>- $L$ : packet length<br>- $R$ : link transmission rate<br>- $d_{trans} = {L / R}$ | $d_{prop}$ : propagation delay<br>- $d$ : length of physical delay<br>- $s$ : propagation speed ($~2 \times 10^8\ m/sec$)<br>- $d_{prop} = {d / s}$  |
## Bad Guys
---
__Packet "sniffing":__ intercepting data sent on a network.
__IP spoofing:__ injection of packet with false source address.
__DoS:__ sending data to a target to overload the server. Called __DDoS__ if multiple hosts are compromised to attack the server at the same time.

## Protocol layers
---

| application | supporting network applications: HTTP, IMAP, SMTP, DNS |
| :--: | ---- |
| transport | process-process data transfer TCP, UDP |
| network | routing from source to destination: IP, routing protocols |
| link | data transfer between neighboring network elements: Ethernet, WiFi, PPP |
| physical | wires and bits sent on wires |
In the __OSI/ISO__ model there are two more layers under the _application_ layer:

| presentation | Allows applications to interpret data (e.g. encryption, compression, etc.) |
| :--: | ---- |
| session | syncronization, checkpointing, recovery of data exchange |
