## Variable Lifetime
---
There are no global variables in Java.
Types of variables:
- global: its lifetime is the program's run-time
- local: variable's lifetime is the lifetime of a particular block
- heap: a variable's lifetime is arbitrary but bounded by the program's run-time
- persistent: its lifetime is arbitrary and may transcend the run-time of the program

__Heap variables__ can be created and destroyed at any time during the program's run-time. It's lifetime ends only when it is destroyed or it becomes unreachable.
