## Types of Relations
---
__Cartesian product:__ edges between all elements. $$\#A = 3, \#B = 2 \Rightarrow \#(A \times B) = 3 \times 2 = 6$$__Relation:__ not all elements from $A$ must be mapped to $B$.
__Mathematical function__ (or __mapping__): all elements of $A$ must be mapped exactly once. $$\#(m: A \rightarrow B) = \#A$$
