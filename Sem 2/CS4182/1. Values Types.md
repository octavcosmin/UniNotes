Different programming languages support different types of values, for example:
- Java: booleans, characters, integers, real numbers, arrays and objects
- C: integers, real numbers, structures, arrays, unions, pointers

## Primitive Types
---
A primitive type: cannot be decomposed into simpler values.
The type of primitive types present in a programming language reflect the intended use:
- Cobol: _fixed-point numbers_ used in commercial data processing (e.g. banks)
- Fortran _real numbers with a choice of precision_ used in scientific and engineering applications

__Common Primitive Types__:
- boolean: `true` or `false`
- char: _a character_
- int
- float

__Composite Types__:
Are composed from simpler types.
E.g.: structures, records, arrays, objects, strings, lists, trees etc.
