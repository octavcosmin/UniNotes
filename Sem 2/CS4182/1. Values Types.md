Different programming languages support different types of [[2. Computers and State#^da392a|values]], for example:
- Java: booleans, characters, integers, real numbers, arrays and objects
- C: integers, real numbers, structures, arrays, unions, pointers
## Primitive Types
---
A primitive type: cannot be decomposed into simpler values.
The type of primitive types present in a programming language reflect the intended use:
- Cobol: _fixed-point numbers_ used in commercial data processing (e.g. banks)
- Fortran _real numbers with a choice of precision_ used in scientific and engineering applications

__Common Primitive Types__:
- boolean: `true` or `false`
- char: _a character_
- int
- float

__Composite Types__:
Are composed from simpler types.
E.g.: structures, records, arrays, objects, strings, lists, trees etc.
## Type Systems
---
A type system groups values into types and restricts operations performed on those values.
E.g.: `int z = x * y;` Must check that both `x` and `y` are integers before evaluating the expression.

__Static vs Dynamic Type Checking:__
- Static: type checking at compile time
- Dynamic: type checking at run time

__Static type checking:__
- Every variable and parameter has a fixed type chosen by the programmer
- The type of each expression can be deduced
- Type checked at compile time

__Dynamic type checking:__
- Only the _values_ have a fixed type
- A variable or parameter has no designated type
- Operands must be type checked at run time immediately before performing an operation

__Expressions__ can be formed in different ways:
- Literals
	Denote a fixed value: 10, 3.14, True, 'c', "CS4182"
- Constructions
	Array constructions: `int numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};`
	Object constructions: `new String("CS4182");`
- Function calls
	`Sin(x)`, an operator can be thought as denoting a function ($\circ E$, $E \circ E$)
- Conditional expressions
	In Java: `x > y ? x : y`
- Constant and variable access
	`public static final double pi = 3.142;`
	`float r;`
	`2 * pi * r`
