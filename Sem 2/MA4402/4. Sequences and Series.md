## Sequences
---
A __Sequence__ is a list of terms (or numbers) arranged in a definite order.
> __Example:__
> 1. $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...\}$
> 2.  $\{1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...\}$

Let a sequence be defined by the formula of its $n$-th term: $$a_n = (1 + {1 \over n})^n$$
## Types of Sequences
---
The sequence $[a_n]$ has a __lower bound__ $L$ if $a_n \geq L$ for all $n$.
The sequence $[a_n]$ has an __upper bound__ if $a_n \leq L$ for all $n$.

A sequence is __positive__ if $a_n \geq 0; \forall n$.
A sequence is __negative__ if $a_n \leq 0; \forall n$.

A sequence is __increasing__ if $a_{n+1} \geq a_n; \forall n$.
A sequence is __decreasing__ if $a_{n+1} \leq a_n; \forall n$.
