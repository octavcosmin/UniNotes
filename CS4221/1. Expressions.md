- Mathematical phrase
	1 + 1
	The 1s are operands
	The "+" is an operator

- Slope of a line (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2)
```math
{Y1 - Y2}/{X1 - X2}
```
__Other notations:__
- Prefix $\sqrt4$

FLOP = Floating point operations per second (~1.3 teraflops for new CPUs)

Types of memory:
- __Cache__: Fast, expensive, small
- __RAM__: Quick, dear, medium
- __Disk__: Slow, cheap, big

Types of computing:
- __IoT__: Low powered devices with small resources. Require efficient programs
- __Edge computing__: Perform computation at the sensor
- __Parallel computing__: Distributed memory

## Prefix notation
The operator goes before the operands `(+ 2 3)`. Interpreted as "Apply plus operator to 2 and 3".

## Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
Is the diagram of expression and shows what the expression does.
E.g. For (+ (- 4 3) 3) the diagram is:
![[CS4221/diagrams/diagram0001.svg]]
`(1 \* 2) + (3 \* 4)` ⇒ `1 \* 2 + 3 \* 4` ⇒ `(+ ( \* 1 2) (\* 3 4))`

Children are often called _arguments_ instead of _operands_.

## How to evaluate a prefix
- Evaluate the most deeply nested first
- `(+ (* (+ 2 1) 3) 4)`
- `(+ (* 3 3) 4)`
- AST: 
  ![[CS4221/diagrams/diagram0002.svg]]
```math
{3a^2}/{1 + 4 - 2}

{-b ± \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}/{2a}
```
